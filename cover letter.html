        <p>Human Resources Manager<br>

        <p>To Whom It May Concern,<br><br>

        As a highly motivated, driven, and focused Help Desk Technician the new opening
        for the Help Desk Level 2 position has caught my interest. With a track
        record of being dependable, hardworking, helpful, and taking initiative I believe
        that I will prove to be valuable in a Level 2 position.<br><br>

        During my time here as a Level 1 Help Desk Technician I have demonstrated my ability
        to assist fellow colleagues in troubleshooting issues by responding to questions in the 
        support chat when my colleagues have questions when available. I also demonstrated initiative
        by taking on creating an updated version of the Lumberjack ticketing tool on own time
        to make ticket noting an easier process to reduce the wrap-up time required when making
        escalations and creating multiple tickets for the same client. I have also shown initiative by 
        reaching to learn how to create the follow up report and running the follow up report when the 
        supervisor is out of office. I also have learned how to run the ambush report and send that as 
        well when the supervisor is out of office. Furthermore, I have also taken initiative to learn what the 
        Disaster Recovery Voicemail is and have been routinely checking it each day on top of my everyday 
        responsibilities as a Level 1 Technician.<br><br>

        I believe my qualifications are reinforced also by the A+ certification that I earned
        by studying and taking the CompTIA A+ certification as well as my ITIL v4 Foundation certification. 
        I continue to learn more every day as I study for my B.S. in Cyber Security & Information Assurance.<br><br>


        Looking forward to hearing from you,<br><br>
