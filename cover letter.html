        <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>

        <p>As a highly motivated, driven and focused Help Desk Technician the new opening
        opening for the Help Desk Level 2 position has peaked my interest. With a track
        record of being dependable, hard working, helpful and taking initiative I believe
        that I will prove to be valuable in a Level 2 position.</p>

        <p>During my time here as a Level 1 Help Desk Technician I have demonstrated my ability
        to assist fellow colleagues in troubleshooting issues. I also demonstrated initiative
        by taking on creating an updated version of the Lumberjack ticketing tool on own time
        to make ticket noting an easier process to reduce the wrap-up time required when making
        escalations. I have also shown initiative by reaching to learn how to create the follow
        up report and running the follow up report when the supervisor is out of office. Furthermore
        I have also taken initiative to learn what the Disaster Recovery Voicemail is and have
        been routinely checking it each day on top of my everyday responsiblities as a Level 1
        Technician.</p>

        <p>I believe my qualifications are reinforced also by the A+ certification that I earned
        by studying and taking the CompTIA A+ certication. I continue to learn more each and
        everyday as I study for my B.S. in Cyber Security & Information Assurance. Along with
        studying for my Bachelor's degree I am also studying to take additional certication for
        Network+, Security+, ITIL Foundation, and Project+.</p>
